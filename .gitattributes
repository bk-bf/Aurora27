# Git LFS tracking for Aurora4x binary files
# filter=lfs  : store content in LFS instead of git objects
# diff=lfs    : skip text diffs for these files
# merge=lfs   : use LFS merge driver (refuses to auto-merge binary files,
#               preventing save file corruption on conflicting pulls)
# -text       : never apply line-ending conversions
